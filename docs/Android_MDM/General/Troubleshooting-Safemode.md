# Safe Mode
This mode is beneficial when it comes to troubleshooting. When you want to check that any additional software that is installed on your mobile phone is creating issues then the best way is to run your mobile phone in a safe mode. Safe mode will deactivate all the non-System and pre-installed apps. So it can help in troubleshooting issues. 
Other cases where Safe mode can help in troubleshooting are: 
<ul>
<li>Phone is working slower than usual.
<li>Troubleshooting a phone that is freezing.
<li>When the phone is acting weirdly e.g restarting on its own, apps are crashing etc.
</ul>
